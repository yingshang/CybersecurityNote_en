# Unauthorized Access Vulnerability in Weblogic

## Vulnerability Description

Weblogic is a J2EE application server introduced by Oracle Corporation. The CVE-2020-14882 allows unauthorised users to bypass the permission verification of the management console and access the backend, while the CVE-2020-14883 allows the backend arbitrary user to execute any command through the HTTP protocol. The exploitation chain consisting of these two vulnerabilities enables an unauthorised any user to execute commands on a remote Weblogic server by means of a GET request.
